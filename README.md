Working in an international environment to cooperate with a Java full stack project. 

## ➡️ The projects

### 1. The calculator

Create a basic Java calculator program that performs the four basic arithmetic operations: addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should take input from the user for two numbers
and an operator, perform the requested operation, and display the result.  
 - [My work](1.%20The%20Calculator%2FTheCalculator%2Fsrc) : 
I created a Calculator class with its method run() to start the program.
This class uses the Scanner and different methods to interact with the user.  
About calculation, I used an ENUM class to create operators with its symbol and a functionnal interface to calculate the result.
Exceptions are also managed.
